# 6th Semester

**🛠️ Data Mining and Analysis**

In this lab, we explore data mining techniques using Python and its libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Key topics include data preprocessing, visualization, clustering, and classification.

**💻 Compiler Design**

This lab covers the phases of a compiler with hands-on implementation of programs related to Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, Intermediate Code Generation, and Code Optimization.

**📊 Modeling and Simulation**

This lab focuses on real-world system modeling and simulation, covering Monte Carlo simulation, discrete-event simulation, and system dynamics to analyze different scenarios.

**🔐 Computer Networks and Security**

In this lab, we study network topologies, IPv4 vs IPv6, subnetting, routing, and security mechanisms. Key topics include packet switching, firewalls, encryption techniques, and secure communication protocols.
