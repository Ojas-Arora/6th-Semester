Make a word scrambler program to scramble every word in the file. Scrambling the word means "keeping first and last letter intact and scramble all other letters randomly". For example, if following is written in file: 
" This is a  new word scrambler program. "  Then 
this will be changed to : 
"Tihs is a wrod srcelabmr pograrm." 
Punctuation marks won't change their position.
